                    troubles while installing the app feel free to reach out through the <a href="https://codecanyon.net/user/crysfel">contact form</a> on my codecanyon profile.</p>
                  <p>This app is build with Laravel 5.6. Laravel is responsible to store data, deal with privilages and authentication as well
                    as serving all the clients. It doesn't return any HTML page because is a REST API. Any client can connect to the server
                    and send/request data in a JSON format.</p>
                  <p>In this case, the client is an AngularJS app, but the client might be a native mobile app, another laravel app, a node client
                    or anything else.</p>

              <p>Laravel 5.6 requires the following dependencies installed in your system.</p>
              <ul>

                <li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>

              <h2 id="installing-wizard">Installation</h2>
              <p>
                For your convenience, I've included an installer that will help you setup everything you need to run this app. The installer
                will check your php version and the required extensions, make sure you have all those ready before proceeding to the next steps.
              </p>
              <p>Before running the installer, you will need a couple things. First and most importantly the mysql database created, you need the credentials and the name of the database you will
                be using. You will also need to have the details for the SMTP server, this information is required to send emails to your users, the installer will allows you to use other services
                such as Mailgun or Amazon SES, but make sure you have this information at hand.
              </p>

              <p>Upload the <strong>musicapp-1.2.0.zip</strong> file to your server, I'd recommend uploading it to `/var/www/yourdomain.com`, but thats completly
                up to you. Unzip the file and make sure the content is not accessible through the internet yet.</p>

              <p>Finally, your HTTP server <strong>must be</strong> resolving the root to `/var/www/yourdomain.com/<strong>musicapp/public</strong>`, this is very important because the way Laravel works, if you don't set the root correctly, the app won't work.
              If you are using cpanel or pdesk, it should be quite easy, if you are using the terminal just update your <a href="#installing-prod">http server configurations</a> accordingly. Also make sure your http server can write into the file system, otherwise the installer won't be able to setup the needed configurations for you.</p>
              
              <div class="row feature">
                <div class="col-sm">
                  Once you have all requirements ready, open your browser and go to http://yourdomain.com<strong>/installer</strong>. Then follow the steps in the installer.

                <div class="col-sm">
                  Make sure you have installed all the required extensions, if any of the extensions is in red, it means is not installed and <strong>you should not</strong> continue the installation until everything is green.

                <div class="col-sm">
                  Follow all the steps and enter the information, each step provide information for the data you need to enter. On the final step click the <strong>Run Installer!</strong> button, seat back and relax! It might take some time, but once everything is green an alert message will appear telling you the app is ready to use! Make sure to click the `Go to home` button, as it will remove the isntaller and lock the system from other people to run it again.

              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                After the installer is done, just double check that the folder <strong>public/installer</strong> is removed! You don't want anyone else to get into these pages. But <strong>most importantly</strong>, make sure the `<strong>storage/app/installed.lock</strong>` file exist. This file is the one that locks the installer, this file will be created automatically for you, but just make sure it's there, if not... just create it, you can put anything as the content.

              <h2 id="installing-api">Manually Installing the REST API</h2>
              <p>Before proceeding to manually installating the REST API, make sure you have all the system requirements installed, such as php, mysql,
                <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>,
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">node</a>, npm.</p>
        
              <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
                Make sure to remove the installer and lock the system. To do that just remove the folder at `<strong>public/installer</strong>` and create a file under `
                <strong>storage/app/installed.lock</strong>`, you can add any content.

                <div class="col-sm">
                  <p>First thing we need to do is to create a database to store the data. This application is using MySQL 5.7 or above.
                    Go ahead and create an empty database with your favorite mysql client, or if you are like me open your terminal
                    and run the following commands.
                  </p>
                  <p>The first command is opening a connection to the MySQL server, it will ask you for your password. In this case
                    I'm using root as the user, but you can use any user that is able to create dabases.</p>
                  <p>The second command is executed inside the mysql server, and is creating an empty database called
                    <strong>music</strong>, feel free to use any name here, just keep in mind that value because we are going to use it later.</p>
                  <p>The third command is just closing the connection with the database.</p>
                  <p>If you are installing in production, I'd recommend you to create a different user to connect from Laravel, also
                    you might want to use a

                    folder and run the following commands.</p>
                  <p>The first command is just opening the app folder. If you are installing in production, I'd recommend you to extract
                    the project under
                    <strong>/var/www/yoursite.com/current</strong>. If installing for development, make sure to remove the flags

                  <p>The second command installs all the dependencies for this project. It will automatically download all packages

              <h4>Do you recommend a hosting provider?</h4>
              <p>Yes, I'd recommend you to use <a href="https://m.do.co/c/3d94e54ec262">Digital Ocean</a>! For $5 a month you can have a server up and running in minutes, they have one click install LAMP or LEMP stacks. And if you use my link, they will give you (and also me) $10 dollars if you use <a href="https://m.do.co/c/3d94e54ec262">my referal link</a> :)</p>

              <h4>How can I change the colors of the app?</h4>
